# Backend Dependency Management

This backend uses `requirements.txt` for inputs and a pinned `requirements.lock` for reproducible installs.

## Recommended (uv)

```sh
cd packages/backend
uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip sync requirements.lock
```

### Update lockfile

```sh
cd packages/backend
uv pip compile requirements.txt -o requirements.lock
```

## Notes

- Use a virtual environment to avoid system-level conflicts.
- `requirements.lock` is generated by `uv` and should be committed.
